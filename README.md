# Tailwind CSS Conflict: Unexpected Style Override

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves seemingly compatible utility classes unexpectedly overriding or producing unintended styling outcomes.

## Bug Description

When applying specific Tailwind CSS classes to an element, the resulting styles deviate from expectations.  The conflict doesn't seem to be related to class specificity or order, making it difficult to diagnose.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` to see the affected code. 
3. Observe the unexpected visual output caused by the conflicting Tailwind classes. 

## Solution

The solution involves a combination of careful class selection, understanding of Tailwind's internal mechanisms, and possibly using overrides or custom styles to achieve the desired visual effects.

See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
